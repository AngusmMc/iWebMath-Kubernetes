How the flow of traffic goes through each port on the

I run a command on my laptop to access the vm and my app
traffic goes from my laptop to port 8080 on the VM (the top layer)
traffic then goes from the VM to the kind cluster which listens on port 30950
it then goes from the kind cluster to the kubernetes service port on port 80
then from the service to the pod ie the apps container on port 5000
then to the flask app itself on port 5000, the flask app is listening on all ports but receives into port 5000 default
